/*
    Shared data model for the simulator.

    DroneState  = physical state of the drone (position and velocity).
    CommandState = user command state (forces and control flags), written by the
                input process and consumed by the drone + UI.
    WorldState  = the full "blackboard" snapshot stored in shared memory and
                protected by a single global semaphore. All processes attach
                to the same WorldState instance and only access it under the
                SIM_SEM_WORLD mutex (check sim_ipc.h for more details).
